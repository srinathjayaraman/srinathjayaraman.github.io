title: Industry Experience
---

Over the course of my masters, I've gained a lot of experience with modern functional and object oriented programming languages, such as Python, Scala, R, and Go-Lang. I have also become familiar with building streaming applications using Apache Spark and Apache Flink in Scala. My work with Scala also required learning AWS, deploying cloud applications, and tuning cloud resources for optimal performance gains and as a result I am well versed in big data analytics using AWS. Additionally, I have extensively utilized Python to create machine learning pipelines to analyze data-sets. Some prominent applications include dimensionality reduction, fraud detection, and anomaly detection. My masters thesis is in the field of Geomatics, which is concerned with the measurement, analysis, and display of geographic and other spatial data. Specifically, my thesis involves using machine learning and front-end visualizations in JavaScript to analyze the growth and change in urban areas, focusing on port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, and London. I am on track to graduate by November 2021.

Prior to the MS, my industry experience as an IT consultant led me to develop a notable interest in computer science, and this became the driving force behind my decision to obtain a masters degree in this field. During my time as a consultant, I gained considerable expertise in SQL and IBM z/OS applications. I was in charge of the Accounts Payable and Logistics applications, which relied heavily on complex SQL queries that needed to be optimized constantly to minimize processing time. I also wrote novel SQL queries to assist in quarterly and year-end financial reporting. I also worked briefly with Unix servers and gained experience in middle-ware that enabled legacy systems to interface with more modern ones. 

From January 2017 until the end of my tenure at Cognizant Technology Solutions in May 2019, I was assigned to work in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This was a novel experience and enabled me to understand work in a multicultural setting. It greatly benefited my communication and interpersonal skills in a professional environment.
