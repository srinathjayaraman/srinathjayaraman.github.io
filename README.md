This is my personal website created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Credits to Jash Mehta for his super-simple tutorial on [*How to make a blog using Hyde (Jekyll) and host it on Github Pages*](https://jashmehta3300.medium.com/how-to-make-a-blog-using-hyde-jekyll-and-host-it-on-github-pages-42123c239b8) and to [Chris Schuld](https://chrisschuld.com/) for inspiring some of the custom design of my personal website.
