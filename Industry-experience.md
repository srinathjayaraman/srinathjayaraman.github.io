title: Industry Experience
---
Prior to the MS, my industry experience as an IT consultant led me to develop a notable interest in computer science, and this became the driving force behind my decision to obtain a masters degree in this field. During my time as a consultant, I gained considerable expertise in SQL and IBM z/OS applications. I was in charge of the Accounts Payable and Logistics applications, which relied heavily on complex SQL queries that needed to be optimized constantly to minimize processing time. I also wrote novel SQL queries to assist in quarterly and year-end financial reporting. I also worked briefly with Unix servers and gained experience in middle-ware that enabled legacy systems to interface with more modern ones. 

From January 2017 until the end of my tenure at Cognizant Technology Solutions in May 2019, I was assigned to work in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This was a novel experience and enabled me to understand work in a multicultural setting. It greatly benefited my communication and interpersonal skills in a professional environment.

Here's an overview of my professional work experience:
