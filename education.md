Over the course of my masters, I've gained a lot of experience with modern functional and object oriented programming languages, such as Python, Scala, R, and Go-Lang. I have also become familiar with building streaming applications using Apache Spark and Apache Flink in Scala. My work with Scala also required learning AWS, deploying cloud applications, and tuning cloud resources for optimal performance gains and as a result I am well versed in big data analytics using AWS. 

Additionally, I have extensively utilized Python to create machine learning pipelines to analyze data-sets. Some prominent applications include dimensionality reduction, fraud detection, and anomaly detection. My masters thesis is in the field of Geomatics, which is concerned with the measurement, analysis, and display of geographic and other spatial data. Specifically, my thesis involves using machine learning and front-end visualizations in JavaScript to analyze the growth and change in urban areas, focusing on port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, and London. I am on track to graduate by November 2022.
